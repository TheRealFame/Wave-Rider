ESC (Amplified T-Squared Mix)
Onoken feat. Detach

ESC is a song made by both Onoken and Detach, two of the best musicians I know. So to
get them together to work on the same song is the stuff of dreams... UNTIL NOW! This is a 
very upbeat track, with a lot of things going on at the same time, which makes for very
good and varied step patterns. And it also makes it hard! I got the song from talking to
Detach over MSN and have loved it ever since! It does sound absolutely nothing like the
original ESC, it is much more suitable for stepping (and shh, but it's better than Onoken's
)!

Graphics beautifully crafted by Detach himself!

Lyrics by myself (with a little help from a lot of people over on FFR!)!

-----BEGINNER-----
A fairly easy 1, could maybe pass for a 2. Not like any of you care, you're not going to
play this. Ever. Unless you're a judge of course, then I sympathise for you, having to
sit through HOURS of dull beginner charts.

-----STANDARD-----
Really simple and hardly technical. It's all 4th notes, and only until near the end do they
get even a little difficult - they are only 4th note streams anyway, mixed in with the odd
freeze or jump, so there's little to worry about for newcomers to DDR. Also the 
slowdowns are really simple and still don't go beyond 4ths, even though the beat is
halved.

-----DIFFICULT-----
I really like this chart! At the start there are a few double taps and freezes which don't
pose too much of a problem, but funnily enough the slowdown starts off MUCH easier
than both Standard AND Beginner! But it quickly adds in a few 8ths and air to fix that
right up! Later on in the chart I start to follow the vocals loosely, but I quite like it! There
are also a few 8th note trills and bursts thrown in near the end, and to finish the song
off, a load of freeze which turns into a jump. Ahhhhh....

-----EXPERT-----
Oh, this is difficult! A very tiring 9, with a lot of everything - air, stream, chaos and freeze
are used really frequently and knacker you out loads, but there is a nice section in the
middle with a slowdown that gives you a little break. Trust me, if you're not a crazy
ITG maniac and can only just clear 10s, you may have trouble with this!  There are a lot
of crossovers plagueing the middle of hard streams which make for a lot of fast footwork.
There are a lot of tricky 16th trills as well near the end which tire you out no end, and the 
final challenge - a hurdle of jumps. It's fun, but furious!

-----CHALLENGE-----
And you thought Expert was hard! This time I decided I wanted to go mine crazy, and I
think it payed off! The mines are easy to avoid, but they confuse you a little bit. so this
chart keeps your concentration and focus always maximized! Anyway, this is the same
foot rating as Expert, but significantly harder - it could pass for a REALLY easy 10 (the
only hard part are the 16th bursts at the end), but yeah, enjoy! And watch out for those
mines - I had my volume on my headphones turned up high and when I hit a mine my
head just imploded.

-----EDIT-----
This should NOT be judged as it is a bonus keyboard file. Anyway, there are a lot of
16th streams and a deadly jumpstream in the climax of the song, but I like it, and I hope
you keyboard freaks/itg nutters like it! And also notice it has absolutely 0 freeze arrows
and no hands, like a lot of keyboard charts nowadays....

I use DDReam to make my simfiles. I cannot play SM since it crashes my PC every time it 
opens up, so DDReam is the next best thing. I am quite good at working it, but inside the
complex programming is a weird thing that gives me a paragraph of BPM shifts and stuff
and some of the largest charts I have ever seen! Do not mistake this for being off-beat, as 
the program also has a way to determine how to make it on-sync throughout. And that's
why my .sm files are retarded!
